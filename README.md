# Password_Generator-
As a software engineer it is vital to know how to use for loops and functions in JavaScript. This project is design to practice my ability to use for loops and function to create a password generator. The purpose of the password generator is to give a user a random password that contains random symbols, numbers, upper case and lower letters. Once the page opens the user has to confirm that they are okay with lower case, upper case, number and symbols. Once the user confirms that those requirements are okay, then  a user clicks generator a random password with the amount of the characters the user entered into the password. Attached is some images of the password generator. This is the link to the password Generator https://tornubarikoboo.github.io/Password_Generator-/
