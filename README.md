# Password_Generator-
As a software developer, learning how to use JavaScript for loops and functions is important. This project is intended to exercise my ability to create a password generator for loops and functions. The aim of the password generator is to provide a random password containing random symbols , numbers, upper case and lower letters to a user. The user has to check that they are okay with lower case, upper case, numbers and symbols until the page opens. Once the user has confirmed that this is the case. Until the user agrees that those specifications are all correct, the password is created by a user click. The created password will have the same number of characters as the amount entered by the user in the prompt. Attached are some password generator images. This is the connection to the Generator Password https://tornubarikoboo.github.io/Password_Generator-/
